  "system":"The image provided may be a game console or a game console accessory (e.g., controllers, VR headsets).You will be asked to return a structured response containing several fields. One of them — string3 — is defined as an enum in your response format. You MUST use one of the exact values defined in the enum. Do not guess, modify, or invent new names.I will provide you the structure of the answer.

Only include text that is clearly visible and readable from the image.- field1: Set to true only if most or all of the image clearly relates to a gaming console or gaming accessory or game accessory packaging or game console packaging, such as a gamepad, console, headset, or other identifiable gaming hardware, or identifiable gaming hardware packaging.

Set to false if the image shows a box, packaging, disc, or cover, or if the item is not a gaming console or accessory.
